# Quantum-Dice-Roller

Very Simple Random Number/Dice Roller program using Python with Quantum Logic. Used Anaconda to set a virtual enviroment
and used Qiskit resources and API to import a Quantum Computer Simulator. I learned how to instantiate a circuit with qubits,
how to put the qubits through a Hadamard gate to put these qubits in Superposition. Learned how to simulate the job on a QVM
(Quantum Virtual Machine) and implemented simple logic to retrieve a random number from 0-7 in binary.
